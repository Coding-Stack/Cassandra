- cassandra is fast distributed db, with high availability and linear scalability.
  It follow peers to peers connection
- in terms of cap theoram, during partition data can't be consistent and high available at same time
  so cassandra choose high availability here as it is difficult to manage consistentcy in distributed database
- consistency levels means the no of replicas whose ack is required for read/write query to mark theoram
  successful operations.
  it can be one or quorom(majority, >50%).
- data is updated in local data center by client then it is async updated in other data centers
