- rdbms used to handle medium data, fits on one machine
- it can supports hundreds of cocurrent users and have acid properties.
- vertically scalable
- in case of replication if we are maintaining the data in master & slave then there will be 
  some replication delay and this replication is sychronous so there can be possibilty that 
  client get some older data, which may fail acid properties.
- when data become complex(lots of tables)then user may have to write some complex queries and if 
  user want to simplfy the query then we need to denormalise the data. which may increase the duplication factor
- sharding is a problem, cuz it may increase the search time complexity and schema changes in shard is also a trouble
- fail over process is difficult to manage which can increase the downtime.
