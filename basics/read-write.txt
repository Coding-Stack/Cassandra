write:
- writes can be written to any node(coordinator node).
- first data is written to a immutable commit log
- then it is updated to inmemory(memtables) which is fixed size memory
- every data contains timestamp, which helps to pick the latest data during read/compaction
- memtables flushed to disk periodically as they have limited storage.
- deletes are called tombstone, which doesn't contains timestamp but can be helper during backup

read:
- any server may queried and act as a coordinator.
- data is picked from sstables and return back to coordinator.
- if consistency level < read-repair then it do read repair to maintain the consistency with latest data
