- clustering column helps the data to be arranged inside the each partition.
- we can perform =,>,< operations on the clustering columns.
- as data is stored in sorted fashion then binary search can also be used.
- order of clustering column in the query should be same as the order in which they are defined inside schema
- clustering column combined with the partition key to build primary key
  PRIMERY KEY((partition_key), clustering_columns...)
- clustering columns as asc as default order.
  WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY(city DESC, name ASC);
- we can't change the primary key dynamically.
- allow filtering search the data inside all partitions
